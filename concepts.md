What Is Command Injection?
Command injection is a cyber attack wherein an attacker takes control of the host operating system by injecting code into a vulnerable application through a command. This code is executed regardless of any security mechanism and can be used to steal data, crash systems, damage databases, and even install malware that can be used later. 
A command injection occurs when an attacker alters the application's default function for executing system commands
Arbitrary File Upload occurs when a file uploaded by a user does not have its file extension checked properly. This in turn could allow a . php file to be uploaded which could result in a full compromise of the website.

How Does a Command Injection Attack Work?
During this stage, threat actors locate a vulnerability in an application which allows them to run malicious operating system commands.
One is to examine the applicationâ€™s source code to identify where system commands are executed with unvalidated user input.
